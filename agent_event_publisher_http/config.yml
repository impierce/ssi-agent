# Configure here to which events will be dispatched to a specific `target_url`. In the example below, the
# `EventPublisherHttp` will listen for the `SIOPv2AuthorizationResponseVerified` event which is part of the `connection`
# aggregate. The events will be dispatched to the `https://my-domain.example.org/event-subscriber` endpoint.

# target_url: &target_url "https://my-domain.example.org/event-subscriber"

# connection: {
#   target_url: *target_url,
#   target_events: [
#     SIOPv2AuthorizationResponseVerified
#   ]
# }
